# IKEA VINDSTYRKA

Hello fellow makers or just anyone who accidentally got here. I recently got this device and was curious about what's inside and whether this can be hacked. Especially while the IKEA Smart app doesn't expose its metrics to HomeKit.

Here's a list of resources I already gathered:

1. [Teardown pictures](teardown.md)
2. [Data dump from DIRIGERA hub](dump.json)

Unfortunately, I didn't manage to pair it with my Raspbee 2. It just didn't appear anywhere except the DIRIGERA hub.

Will try to play with test points and interfaces in the future. Feel free to contribute if you have anything interesting. Let's keep it all in one place ðŸ™‚
